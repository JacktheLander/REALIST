# REALIST

<img src="Capture.png" />

Realist is a Windows application I created in Python in collaboration with realtors at Brown Harris Stevens to generate and manage their leads. It uses data sourced from Endato API, services from Google Cloud Platform, and user databasing from Stripe API services to provide a user experience that is simple and effective.
